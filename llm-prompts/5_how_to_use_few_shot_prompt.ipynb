    "## Few-shot learning prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot learning in the context of prompting involves teaching a language model to perform a task by showing it only a small number of examples. Essentially, you provide a few samples of the input along with the desired output, and the model learns to generalize from these examples to new, similar tasks. This method is useful for adapting the model to specific tasks without extensive training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows LLMs to adapt to a wide variety of tasks without extensive retraining or fine-tuning on large datasets.\n",
