    "# OpenAI Assistants APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "The Assistants' API lets you create AI assistants in your applications. These assistants follow instruction. They use models, tools, and knowledge to answer user questions. In this notebook we are going to use one of the tools, retriever, to query against two pdf documents we will upload.\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture and data flow diagram below depicts the interaction among all components that comprise OpenAI Assistant APIs. Central to understand is the Threads and Runtime that executes asynchronously, adding and reading messages to the Threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "For integrating the Assistants API:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creat an Assistant with custom instructions and select a model. Optionally, enable tools like Code Interpreter, Retrieval, and Function Calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initiate a Thread for each user conversation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Add user queries as Messages to the Thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Run the Assistant on the Thread for responses, which automatically utilizes the enabled tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we follow those steps to demonstrate how to integrate Assistants API, using Retrieval tool, to a) upload a couple of pdf documents and b) use Assistant to query the contents of the document. Consider this as a mini Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). \n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenAI documentation describes in details [how Assistants work](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works).\n",
