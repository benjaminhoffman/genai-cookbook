I cannot directly generate HTML content or an interactive map within this text-based platform. However, I can provide you with an example of HTML code that you can use to embed a simple map with markers using a service like Google Maps API or any other mapping service that supports marker placement. You'll need to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from the mapping service provider.

Here's a basic example using Google Maps JavaScript API:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Ray Meetup Locations</title>
  <style>
    #map {
      height: 400px;
      width: 100%;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h3>Ray Meetup Locations Map</h3>
  <div id="map"></div>
  <script>
    function initMap() {
      var sanFrancisco = {lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194};
      var newYork = {lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060};
      var london = {lat: 51.5074, lng: -0.1278};

      var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {
        zoom: 2,
        center: sanFrancisco
      });

      var sfMarker = new google.maps.Marker({
        position: sanFrancisco,
        map: map,
        title: 'San Francisco Ray Meetup'
      });

      var nyMarker = new google.maps.Marker({
        position: newYork,
        map: map,
        title: 'New York Ray Meetup'
      });

      var londonMarker = new google.maps.Marker({
        position: london,
        map: map,
        title: 'London Ray Meetup'
      });
    }
  </script>
  <script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Please note that you need to sign up for Google Cloud and enable the Maps JavaScript API to get the API key. There are also usage limits and potential costs associated with its use.

To use the example, replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Google Maps API key, and the markers should appear on the map at the specified coordinates for San Francisco, New York, and London.

Keep in mind that Google Maps has its terms of service that you must comply with when using their API. There are other mapping services like OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, or Leaflet, which might offer different features and terms that could better suit your needs.
