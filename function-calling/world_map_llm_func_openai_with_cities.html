Given the limitations of the platform, I cannot directly create or host HTML content. However, I can provide you with the basic HTML structure containing the coordinates which you could use to create an HTML file yourself. Below is a sample HTML code embedding a mock-up for representing the given coordinates. It is up to you to integrate actual mapping functionality using a service like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap and their respective APIs.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Ray Meetups</title>
    <style>
        #map {
            height: 400px;
            width: 100%;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Ray Meetup Locations</h1>

    <div id="map">
        <!-- You need to replace this part with an actual map integration -->
        <p>San Francisco Coordinates: Latitude 37.7749, Longitude -122.4194</p>
        <p>New York Coordinates: Latitude 40.7128, Longitude -74.006</p>
        <p>London Coordinates: Latitude 51.5074, Longitude -0.1276</p>
    </div>

    <script>
        // You will need to add JavaScript code here to initialize and display an actual map
        // This usually involves using an API like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap
    </script>
</body>

</html>
```

To create a functioning map, you would need to replace the comments with the appropriate API code from a mapping provider. This will convert the static coordinates into dynamic maps showing each city's location. Please note that use of these APIs typically requires you to sign up for an API key from the respective service provider.
