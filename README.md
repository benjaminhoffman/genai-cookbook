# Genai-Cookbook

<img src=images/cookbook.png>

Welcome a mix of Gen AI cookbook how-to recepies for Gen AI applications. This span across simple getting started examples on promppting, chatbots, retrieval generation augmentation (RAGs), etc. 

You'll find examples code and guides for common tasks using the OpenAI API. To try these examples, you'll need a free [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) account and an associated API key and an [Anyscale Endpoint](https://www.anyscale.com/get-started) account and associated key. 

Most examples are in Python, yet the concepts can be adapted to any programming language, so long as you can make REST API calls or target language SDK API calls.

Have fun!
