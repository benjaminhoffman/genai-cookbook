# Genai-Cookbook

<img src=images/cookbook.png width="75%" height="45%">

Welcome to a mixture of Gen AI cookbook **how-to** recepies for Gen AI applications. These simple guides span across get-started examples on LLM prompting strategies, building simple chatbots, retrieval generation augmentation (RAGs), LLM-based applications on ChatGPT or Anyscale Endpoings, etc. 

You'll find examples code and/or guides for common tasks using the OpenAI API and [Ray framework](https://www.ray.io/). 

To try these examples, you'll need a free [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) account and an associated API key or an [Anyscale Endpoint](https://www.anyscale.com/get-started) account and an associated key. 

Most examples are in Python, yet the concepts can be adapted to any programming language, so long as you can make REST API calls or target language SDK API calls.

The examples in this cook are inspired (and some modified, expanded or copied) from these resources, including:

 * [Open AI Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook)
 * [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction) and [Prompt Engineering course](https://maven.com/dair-ai/prompt-engineering-llms?promoCode=MAVENMONDAY) by Elvis Saravia
 * [Ray Documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/) and [Anyscale blogs](https://www.anyscale.com/blog)
 * [Anyscale Endpoints Documentation](https://docs.endpoints.anyscale.com/)
 * [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-prompt-eng/lesson/1/introduction)
 * [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain/lesson/1/introduction)
 * [Building Systems with the ChatGPT API](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-building-system/lesson/1/introduction)
 * Various blog posts on medium.

## Environment files
Since you use use either OpenAI and Anyscale Endpoints, I provide two
environment template files: **.env_anyscale_template** and **env_openai_template**. Add your keys and model name to either of the files and copy the file to **.env**. 

**Note**: Don't share your environment files with API keys publicly.

## Contributing
I welcome contributions. Let's make this a Generative AI developer community-driven resource. Your contributions can include addittions or expansions of these how-to guides.

Check existing [issues](https://github.com/dmatrix/genai-cookbook/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/dmatrix/genai-cookbook/pulls) before contributing to avoid duplication. If you have ideas or suggestions for examples or guides, share them on the issues page


Have fun!
