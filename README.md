# Genai-Cookbook

<img src=images/cookbook.png>

Welcome to a mixture of Gen AI cookbook **how-to** recepies for Gen AI applications. These simple guides span across get-started examples on prompting strategies, building simple chatbots, retrieval generation augmentation (RAGs), etc. 

You'll find examples code and/or guides for common tasks using the OpenAI API and [Ray framework](https://www.ray.io/). 

To try these examples, you'll need a free [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) account and an associated API key or an [Anyscale Endpoint](https://www.anyscale.com/get-started) account and an associated key. 

Most examples are in Python, yet the concepts can be adapted to any programming language, so long as you can make REST API calls or target language SDK API calls.

Have fun!
