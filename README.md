# Genai-Cookbook

<img src=images/cookbook.png>

Welcome to a mixture of Gen AI cookbook **how-to** recepies for Gen AI applications. These simple guides span across get-started examples on prompting strategies, building simple chatbots, retrieval generation augmentation (RAGs), etc. 

You'll find examples code and/or guides for common tasks using the OpenAI API and [Ray framework](https://www.ray.io/). 

To try these examples, you'll need a free [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) account and an associated API key or an [Anyscale Endpoint](https://www.anyscale.com/get-started) account and an associated key. 

Most examples are in Python, yet the concepts can be adapted to any programming language, so long as you can make REST API calls or target language SDK API calls.

The examples in this cook are inspired (and some modified or copied) from these resources, including:

 * [Open AI Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook)
 * [Prompt Engineering Guide] and [Prompt Engineering course](https://maven.com/dair-ai/prompt-engineering-llms?promoCode=MAVENMONDAY) by Elvis Saravia
 * [Ray Documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/) and [Anyscale blogs](https://www.anyscale.com/blog)
 * [Anyscale Endpoints Documentation](https://docs.endpoints.anyscale.com/)
 * Various blog posts on medium.

Have fun!
