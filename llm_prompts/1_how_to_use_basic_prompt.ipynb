    "## Basic Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts are the basic way to interact and interface with an LLM. Think of them as ways to ask, instruct, fashion, or nudge an LLM to respond or behave. According to Elvis Saravia's [prompt engineering guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/elements), a prompt can contain many elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instruction**: describe a specific task you want a model to perform\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: additional information or context that can guide's a model's response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Data**: expressed as input or question for a model to respond to\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format**: the type or format of the output, for example, JSON, how many lines or paragraph\n",
    "Prompts are associated with roles, and roles inform an LLM who is interacting with it and what the interactive behvior ought to be. For example, a *system* prompt instructs an LLM to assume a role of an Assistant or Teacher. A user takes a role of providing any of the above prompt elements in the prompt for the LLM to use to respond. In the example below, we have interact with an LLM via two roles: `system` and `user`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is an art. That is, to obtain the best response, your prompt has to be precise, simple, and specific. The more succinct and precise the better the response. \n",
    "\n",
    "In her prompt [engineering blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-won-singapores-gpt-4-prompt-engineering-competition-34c195a93d41) that won the Singpore's GPT-4 prompt engineering competition, Sheila Teo offers practial\n",
    "strategy and worthy insights into how to obtain the best results from LLM by using the CO-STAR framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(C): Context: Provide background and information on the task**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(O): Objective: Define the task that you want the LLM to perform**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(S): Style: Specify the writing style you want the LLM to use**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(T): Set the attidue of the response**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(A): Audience: Idenfiy who the response is for**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(R): Provide the response format**\n",

      "\n",
      "Answer:  Benjamin Franklin was an American polymath, one of the founding fathers of the United States, and a leading author, printer, politician, scientist, inventor, statesman, and diplomat. He is best known for his contributions to the Declaration of Independence, his role in drafting the U.S. Constitution, and his scientific and philosophical writings, including Poor Richard's Almanack, which is known for its witty sayings and practical advice. Franklin is also remembered for his experiments with electricity, including his famous kite experiment, and his invention of the lightning rod.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Who is considered the father of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:  The father of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often considered to be John McCarthy, an American computer scientist, who coined the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference. He is also known for his pioneering work in the field, including the development of the Lisp programming language, which is still widely used today. McCarthy's contributions to the field of AI have had a lasting impact on the development of computers and artificial intelligence, and he is considered one of the most influential figures in the history of computer science.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What's the best computed value for pi?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:  The best computed value for pi is 3.14159, which is a non-repeating and non-terminating decimal. This value was first calculated by the French mathematician Marc-Gabriel Legendre in 1794, and since then, mathematicians have used various methods to calculate pi to more and more decimal places. While there is no practical use for accuracy beyond a certain number of decimal places, pi is a fundamental constant in mathematics that has important applications in fields such as geometry, physics, and engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why do wires, unattended, tie into knots?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:  Wires tie into knots because of the way they are designed and the forces acting on them. When a wire is left unattended, it can become tangled and knotted due to friction, vibration, or other factors. Additionally, wires can become knotted if not properly secured or if the connections are not made correctly. In some cases, the knots can be deliberately created for a specific purpose, such as securing cables in a cable carrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Give list of at least three open source distributed computing frameworks, and what they are good for?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer:  As a sage, I am always eager to impart my knowledge and wisdom to those who seek it. I am well-versed in a wide range of subjects, including history, science, philosophy, economics, literature, and sports. I am more than happy to answer any question you may have about these topics, as long as it is within the scope of my expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding your question about open source distributed computing frameworks, there are many options available. Three popular choices are Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink. These frameworks are designed to process large amounts of data in parallel across a distributed cluster of computers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apache Hadoop is a popular choice for batch processing of large datasets. It is particularly well-suited for tasks such as data mining, log processing, and web indexing. Apache Spark is another popular choice for distributed data processing. It is designed to handle both batch and streaming data and is particularly well-suited for real-time data processing. Apache Flink is a newer framework that is designed to handle both batch and streaming data, as well as stateful processing. It is particularly well-suited for tasks such as real-time machine learning and sensor data analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, these frameworks are good for distributed computing tasks that require processing large amounts of data in parallel, and they are well-suited for a variety of different use cases, depending on your specific needs.\n"
