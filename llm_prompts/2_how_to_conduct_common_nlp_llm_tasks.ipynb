Their thick fur coats and sharp instincts help them survive in this unforgiving environment, where temperatures can drop to -40 degrees Celsius and the snowdrifts stretch for miles. Despite their fearsome reputation, these majestic creatures are also surprisingly social, often forming close-knit packs that work together to hunt and protect their territory. In fact, scientists have observed that wolves in Siberia have a complex communication system, using a variety of vocalizations, body language, and even scent markings to communicate with each other. By studying their behavior, researchers have gained valuable insights into the importance of cooperation and teamwork in the natural world.\n",

Though he had always been interested in the written word, it wasn't until he saw the intricate mechanics of the printing press in action that he knew he had found his true calling. He spent every spare moment learning everything he could about the process, from the mixing of ink to the arrangement of type. His dedication paid off, and soon he was running his own printing business, producing everything from newspapers to broadsides to books. His love of printing led him to invent the Franklin stove, bifocal glasses, and even the lightning rod, all of which further solidified his reputation as a master of innovation and creativity.\n",

They hypothesize that this is due to the sequential nature of textual encodings, and test this by creating a new benchmark, the 1D-ARC, which uses one-dimensional tasks that are more conducive to GPT-based reasoning. They also propose an object-based representation that improves GPT-4's performance on the ARC tasks and achieves near-perfect scores on the 1D-ARC.
