    "## Basic Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts are the basic way to interact and interface with an LLM. Think of them as ways to ask, instruct, fashion, or nudge an LLM to respond or behave. According to Elvis Saravia's prompt engineering guide, a prompt can contain many elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instruction**: describe a specific task you want a model to perform\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: additional information or context that can guide's a model's response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Data**: expressed as input or question that for a model to respond to\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format** :the type or format of the output, for example, JSON, how many lines or paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts are associated with roles, and roles inform an LLM who is interacting with it and what the interactive behvior ought to be. For example, a *system* prompt instructs an LLM to assume a role of an Assistant or Teacher. A user takes a role of providing any of the above prompt elements in the prompt for the LLM to use to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we have interact with an LLM via two roles: `system` and `user`.\n"

      "Question: Who was Benjamin Franklin, and what is he most known for?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Benjamin Franklin was a true polymath, a jack-of-all-trades who dabbled in everything from politics to physics. Born in Boston in 1706, he became one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, a statesman, author, publisher, scientist, inventor, and diplomat. He is most famed for his role in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, and as the face gracing the $100 bill, reminding everyone that a penny saved is a hundred dollars earned—or something like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the scientific front, Franklin is celebrated for his experiments with electricity, most notably the iconic image of him flying a kite in a thunderstorm to demonstrate the electrical nature of lightning, which led to the invention of the lightning rod. Not content with just shocking discoveries, he also invented the bifocal glasses, proving that he could see into the future—of vision correction, at least. His wit and wisdom endure through his Poor Richard's Almanack, where he served timeless slices of advice, such as \"Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Who has won the most World Cups in soccer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: The national team with the most World Cup victories is Brazil. They have triumphed a remarkable five times, securing the title in the years 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994, and 2002. Their vibrant and rhythmic style of play, often referred to as \"samba football,\" has delighted fans worldwide and ensured their place at the pinnacle of the sport.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their collection of stars over the years, including Pelé, Romário, Ronaldo, and many others, have become legends in their own right, etching their names in the annals of football history. While other nations may challenge their record, Brazil's yellow and green jersey remains a symbol of excellence on the football pitch, and their achievements serve as a benchmark for success in the world's most beloved game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What's the best computed value for pi?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: The best computed value for pi, as of my last update, is a staggering 62.8 trillion decimal places, achieved by Timothy Mullican in January 2020. This Herculean task was accomplished using a computer with an impressive 768GB of RAM and 1.25 petabytes of storage space, demonstrating that when it comes to crunching numbers, more is indeed merrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, for most practical purposes, such as engineering or even rocket science, just a handful of decimal places—say, 3.14159—are more than sufficient. As mathematicians and enthusiasts continue to push the boundaries, it's clear that the quest for more digits of pi is less about practical application and more about human curiosity and the joy of setting records. Remember, whenever you feel like you're going in circles trying to understand pi, you're actually spiraling into infinite wonder!\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why does oil float on water?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Oil floats on water because its density is lower than that of water. Density is essentially how much stuff is packed into a certain amount of space; in this case, water molecules are more tightly packed together compared to those in oil. This causes oil, which is made up of less dense molecules, to rise above water when the two are mixed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it like a crowded elevator: water molecules are like a group of people standing shoulder-to-shoulder inside, while oil molecules are like a few folks who prefer personal space and thus stay on top, rather than squeezing in. Additionally, water is a polar molecule, meaning it has a slight electrical charge that makes it stick to itself very well, whereas oil is nonpolar and doesn't mix with water's clique, reinforcing the separation and the floating effect of oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Give list of at least three open source distributed computing frameworks, and what they are good for?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Ah, my curious pupil, let's delve into the treasure trove of open source distributed computing frameworks. Firstly, we have Apache Hadoop, a stalwart in the realm of big data processing. It's akin to a wise old wizard, capable of handling vast amounts of data across clusters of computers using simple programming models. Hadoop is particularly adept at data storage with its Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and at processing with its MapReduce computing model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we encounter Apache Spark, a sprightly young apprentice to Hadoop, but with a flair for speed and efficiency. Spark excels at real-time data processing, outpacing Hadoop with its in-memory processing capabilities, which is quite the feat! It's a master of diverse tasks, from SQL queries to streaming and machine learning, making it a jack-of-all-trades in the data analytics guild. Lastly, there's TensorFlow, the sorcerer of the group, specializing in deep learning and artificial neural networks. It's the go-to framework for those desiring to conjure up intelligent models capable of tasks like image and speech recognition. With its flexibility and power, TensorFlow is a favorite among the magicians of machine learning.\n"
