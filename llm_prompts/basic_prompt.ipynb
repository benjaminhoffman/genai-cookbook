    "## Basic Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts are the basic way to interact and interface with an LLM. Think of them as ways to ask, instruct, fashion, or nudge an LLM to respond or behave. According to Elvis Saravia's [prompt engineering guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/elements), a prompt can contain many elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instruction**: describe a specific task you want a model to perform\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: additional information or context that can guide's a model's response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Data**: expressed as input or question for a model to respond to\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Format**: the type or format of the output, for example, JSON, how many lines or paragraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts are associated with roles, and roles inform an LLM who is interacting with it and what the interactive behvior ought to be. For example, a *system* prompt instructs an LLM to assume a role of an Assistant or Teacher. A user takes a role of providing any of the above prompt elements in the prompt for the LLM to use to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we have interact with an LLM via two roles: `system` and `user`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's paramount to mention that prompt engineering is an art. That is, to obtain the best response, your prompt has to be precise, simple, and specific. The more succinct and precise the better the response. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try first with simple examples, and then proceed into constructing prompts that lead to solving or responding to simple and complex reasoning. The examples below illustracte simple prompting. \n",

      "\n",
      "Answer: Benjamin Franklin was a polymath who lived in the 18th century; he was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Not only was he a skilled diplomat and statesman, but he also made significant contributions as an inventor, scientist, and author. Franklin is most known for his role in drafting the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, and for his experiments with electricity, which famously involved flying a kite during a thunderstorm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from his political and scientific achievements, Franklin was the face on the hundred-dollar bill, often lending him the nickname \"Benjamins\" in popular culture. His witty Poor Richard's Almanack and numerous inventions, including the lightning rod, bifocal glasses, and the Franklin stove, also cement his legacy. Meanwhile, he managed to maintain a sense of humor, once quipping that \"in this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Who is considered the father of Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: The title \"father of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\" often goes to John McCarthy, an American computer scientist. McCarthy was instrumental in defining the field dedicated to the development of intelligent machines. He coined the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" in his 1955 proposal for the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, the seminal event that marked the birth of AI as a field of research. \n",
      "\n",
      "McCarthy's contributions weren't just in naming the field; he also developed the programming language Lisp, which became crucial in AI development, and he was involved in many of the early milestones of AI research. While others, like Alan Turing, have also made significant contributions to the field and its philosophical foundations, it's McCarthy's direct impact on the establishment and direction of AI that earns him the affectionate nickname among many in the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What's the best computed value for pi?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Ah, the elusive number pi, a mathematical constant that fascinates the curious minds! The best computed value for pi, as of my last update, is a whopping 31.4 trillion decimal places, a heroic feat accomplished by Timothy Mullican in 2020. Though, keep in mind, for most practical applications, like calculating the circumference of a circle or the area of a pie—pun intended—a mere handful of decimal places will suffice; after all, NASA only uses about 15 decimal places of pi for interplanetary navigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to tickle your funny bone, imagine if we tried to write down all the digits of pi; we'd sooner run out of ink or paper, or perhaps the patience of anyone waiting to use pi. And remember, no matter how precisely we compute it, pi remains an irrational number, never repeating or terminating, much like a teenager's argument on why they need a new phone!\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why does oil float on water?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Oil floats on water because it is less dense than water. Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume, and since oil has a lower density, it rises to the surface when mixed with water. Additionally, oil and water are immiscible liquids, meaning they don't mix at a molecular level due to differences in their polarity; water molecules are polar, while oil molecules are nonpolar.\n",
      "\n",
      "If oil and water had a relationship status, it would definitely be \"It's complicated,\" with water's polar molecules sticking together like gossiping friends at a party, leaving the nonpolar oil molecules to form their own clique on the surface. This separation is the reason you get that slick layer of oil on top of water, and why salad dressings need a good shake before use!\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Give list of at least three open source distributed computing frameworks, and what they are good for?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Ah, my inquisitive pupil, let us delve into the digital cornucopia of open source distributed computing frameworks. Firstly, we have Apache Hadoop, the venerable juggernaut of big data processing. With its HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and MapReduce processing engine, it's excellent for crunching vast amounts of data across many machines, much like a digital Pac-Man munching through data dots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, behold Apache Spark, the lightning-fast successor to Hadoop's throne. Spark is renowned for its speed and ease of use in data analytics, especially when dealing with iterative algorithms in machine learning and data mining. It's like a caffeinated librarian, rapidly sorting through the world's information with deft and precision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, there's TensorFlow, an open source library developed by the Google Brain team. While not a distributed computing framework in the traditional sense, it shines when distributed across multiple CPUs or GPUs. It's the go-to for deep learning tasks, adept at teaching computers to see, hear, and understand the world around us, much like a digital sensei for machines.\n"
