He apprenticed under his brother, James, absorbing the art of typesetting and the power of the press. His curiosity and drive led him to establish his own printing business, which became the foundation for his future success. As a printer, he published the Pennsylvania Gazette and Poor Richard's Almanack, works that would cement his reputation as a major figure in colonial American culture.

To address this limitation, researchers introduced a one-dimensional version of ARC (1D-ARC), where GPT-4 showed improved results. Through the use of an externally-derived object-based representation, GPT-4's performance on ARC tasks nearly doubled, and it achieved high accuracy on the simpler 1D-ARC.
