Welcome to this section on prompt engineering, tailored for anyone seeking practical insights into prompt engineering to use LLMs. We kick off with the basics of simple prompting, guiding you on crafting effective prompts: a fundamental skill for various generative tasks. Journey with us into text generation and completion, exploring tips for text summarization and extracting key information seamlessly: [basic_prompt](./1_basic_prompt.ipynb)
    
Learn techniques for text classification and sentiment analysis, honing your ability to guide language models accurately. The exploration extends to text categorization, text transformation, and translation, where you'll witness language models reshaping and interpreting content. Then take a deep dive into how to ask LLM to approach simple and complex reasoning tasks, empowering you to guide models through logical challenges, and then cap it off with code generation: [basic_llm_tasks](./2_basic_llm_tasks.ipynb)

Vision-to-text models are like intelligent computers that look at pictures and describe them using words, forming a bridge between visual understanding and language processing. These models are valuable for tasks such as creating captions, assisting individuals with visual impairments, and enhancing computers' ability to comprehend and articulate the content of images. As they continue to advance, vision-to-text models contribute to a more nuanced and interactive relationship between computers and the visual world. We explore that vision capability in this notebook:
