    "## Chain of thought (CoT) prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain of thought prompting for LLMs involves providing a sequence of reasoning steps in the prompt to guide the model toward a solution. This technique helps the model to process complex problems by breaking them down into intermediate steps, much like a human would. By mimicking human-like reasoning, chain of thought prompting improves the model's ability to handle tasks that require logic and deduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Wei et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) (2022) introduced chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which uses steps to help solve complex problems. By adding few-shot prompts, it works even better for tasks that need careful thinking before answering, giving the model time to \"think.\" This can simply be achieved as prompting or instructing the LLM to \"Let's think through this step and step. Solve each step and explain how to arrived at your answer.\" This instructions eliminates the need to explicitly proivde \"few-shot\" examples. This combination helps in tackling more difficult tasks effectively. \n",
