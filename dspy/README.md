## DSPy - Programing language for LLMs

### Quick overview: what and why use DSPy
DSPy is a framework for optimizing Language Model (LM) prompts and weights in complex systems, especially when using LMs multiple times within a pipeline. 

The process of using LMs without DSPy involves breaking down problems into steps, prompting the LM effectively for each step, adjusting steps to work together, generating synthetic examples for tuning, and finetuning smaller LMs to reduce costs. This process is currently challenging and messy, requiring frequent changes to prompts or finetuning steps whenever the pipeline, LM, or data are altered. 

DSPy addresses these issues by separating program flow from LM parameters and introducing new optimizers that tune LM prompts and/or weights based on a desired metric. DSPy can train powerful models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as well as smaller models such as T5-base or Llama2-13b, to perform more reliably at tasks by optimizing their prompts and weights. 

DSPy optimizers generate custom instructions, few-shot prompts, and weight updates for each LM, creating a new paradigm where LMs and their prompts are treated as optimizable components of a larger learning system. 

In summary, DSPy enables less prompting, higher scores, and a more systematic approach to solving complex tasks using Language Models.

### Some Python Code Examples

The Python code exampples illustrate how to program LLM with in-line DSPy signatures and Class Signatures modules. Also, how to implement common NLP tasks using DSPy modules, programming the LLM, rather than prompting the LLM.

All examples use OLlama Mistral, running locally on the laptop, and experimental DSPy [dspy.OLlama](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/docs/building-blocks/language_models#local-lms) client integration APIs. Have a peek ðŸ‘€ on GitHub!

 **Note** that some of these tasks have been converted from [LLM Prompts notebook](https://github.com/dmatrix/genai-cookbook/blob/main/llm-prompts/2_how_to_conduct_common_nlp_llm_tasks.ipynb) using [CO-STAR framework](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-won-singapores-gpt-4-prompt-engineering-competition-34c195a93d41) prompt techniques.
