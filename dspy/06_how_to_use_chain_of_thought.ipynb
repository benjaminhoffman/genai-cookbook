    "\n",
    "Chain of thought prompting for LLMs involves providing a sequence of reasoning steps in the prompt to guide the model toward a solution. This technique helps the model to process complex problems by breaking them down into intermediate steps, much like a human would. By mimicking human-like reasoning, chain of thought prompting improves the model's ability to handle tasks that require logic and deduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Wei et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) (2022) introduced chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which uses steps to help solve complex problems. By adding few-shot prompts, it works even better for tasks that need careful thinking before answering, giving the model time to \"think.\" This can simply be achieved as prompting or instructing the LLM to \"Let's think through this step and step. Solve each step and explain how to arrived at your answer.\" These instructions eliminate the need to explicitly provide \"few-shot\" examples. This combination helps in tackling more difficult tasks effectively. \n",

      "Step 1: Calculate the cost savings with the 35% discount and waived fees for three months. The monthly fee is $55.00, and there's a 35% discount for joining before December 31, 2023. So, the discounted monthly fee will be $55.00 * (1 - 0.35) = $36.25. Since the first three months' fees are waived, we only need to calculate the cost for the remaining nine months: $36.25 * 9 = $326.25.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 2: Calculate the cost savings with the 25% discount and waived one month's fee. The monthly fee is $55.00, and there's a 25% discount for joining in January 2024. So, the discounted monthly fee will be $55.00 * (1 - 0.25) = $43.75. Since only one month's fee is waived, the total cost for a one-year subscription would be $43.75 * 12 = $525.20.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Compare the savings in both scenarios and determine the best option. Comparing the two options, the first scenario with the 35% discount and waived fees for three months results in a total cost of $326.25, while the second scenario with the 25% discount and waived one month's fee results in a total cost of $525.20. Based on this comparison, the first scenario is the best option for saving costs on a one-year health club subscription.\n",
