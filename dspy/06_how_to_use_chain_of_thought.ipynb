    "## Chain of thought (CoT) prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain of thought prompting for LLMs involves providing a sequence of reasoning steps in the prompt to guide the model toward a solution. This technique helps the model to process complex problems by breaking them down into intermediate steps, much like a human would. By mimicking human-like reasoning, chain of thought prompting improves the model's ability to handle tasks that require logic and deduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Wei et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) (2022) introduced chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which uses steps to help solve complex problems. By adding few-shot prompts, it works even better for tasks that need careful thinking before answering, giving the model time to \"think.\" This can simply be achieved as prompting or instructing the LLM to \"Let's think through this step and step. Solve each step and explain how to arrived at your answer.\" These instructions eliminate the need to explicitly provide \"few-shot\" examples. This combination helps in tackling more difficult tasks effectively. \n",

      "\u001b[1mResaoning:\u001b[0m: 1. First, we need to find out how much money you make in one week. You are offered $125.00 per hour and work 30 hours a week. So, your weekly earnings are $125.00/hour * 30 hours/week = $37,500.00/week.\n",
      "2. Next, we need to find out how much money you make in six months. There are approximately 4.33 weeks in a month, so there are 6 months * 4.33 weeks/month = 25.98 months in six months.\n",
      "3. To find your total earnings for the contract, we multiply your weekly earnings by the number of weeks in the contract: $37,500.00/week * 25.98 weeks = $961,250.00. However, since this is an overestimation due to the rounding error in step 2, we'll adjust it down to $961,250.00 / 0.9999999 = $969,749.53 ≈ $968,750.00.\n",
      "4. Finally, since the problem asks for the answer in dollars, we round down to the nearest thousand: $968,750.00 → $968,000.00. Therefore, you will make a total of $968,000.00 by the end of your contract.\n",
      "5. However, since the problem initially stated that you make $125.00 an hour and work 30 hours a week, we can calculate the exact amount without rounding errors: $125.00/hour * 30 hours/week * 4.33 weeks/month * 6 months = $78,750.00/month * 6 months = $472,500.00 + $315,000.00 = $787,500.00. Therefore, the correct answer is: Result: $787,500.00.\n",
